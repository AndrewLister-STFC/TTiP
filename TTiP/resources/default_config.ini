[PHYSICS]
# The physics section is used to enable/disable physical limits.

# limit_conductivity (bool): Enable the lower limit on conductivity?
# limit_flux (bool): Enable flux limiting?
limit_conductivity: on
limit_flux: on

[SOLVER]
# The solver section defines which solver to use and where to store the
# results.

# file_path (string): The path to store the result in.
# method (string): The method to use for time dependant problems.
#     Avalilable options are: ForwardEuler, BackwardEuler, CrankNicolson, and Theta.
# theta (float): **Theta method only** The theta parameter for a theta model solve.
file_path: ttip_results/result.pvd
method: CrankNicolson

[MESH]
# The mesh is defined by a type and parameters.
# Mesh types include all UtilityMeshes in firedrake as well as the option to
# read from a file.
#
# To create a mesh from file, stored at <filename>, use:
# type: Mesh
# params: <filename>
#
# For information on Utility meshes, see the firedrake docs:
# https://firedrakeproject.org/firedrake.html#module-firedrake.utility_meshes

# type (string): Which Mesh builder to use.
# params (comma seperated list): The params for the given mesh builder.
# element (string): The type of element to use in the mesh. CG should be fine for most cases.
# order (int): The order of the element to use in the mesh.
#              This is the complexity of each element, in most cases 1 will suffice.
#              Increasing this can slow down runtimes.
type: Box
params: 20, 20, 20, 4e-5, 4e-5, 4e-5

element: CG
order: 1


[PARAMETERS]
# Any parameters are defined by name.
# For example the below defines the density parameter.
# A parameter will only be used if one of the mixins requests it.
# Parameters follow the same pattern as other functions which can be read about
# below.
#
# Defining the ionisation parameter will use the constant iononisation formulation,
# whereas if it is not defined, TTiP will use the non-constant ionisation formula.
#
# No defaults are provided. Options are given below:
# atomic_number
# coulomb_ln
# electron_density
# ion_density
# ionisation

[SOURCES]
# Any sources that are defined here will be summed to produce a final source
# term.
# Sources follow the same pattern as other functions which can be read about
# below.
#
# The default is no source term.
# default_source: 0

[BOUNDARIES]
# Boundary conditions can be defined for each boundary surface in the mesh.
# Problems can have no boundary conditions by leaving this section empty,
# otherwise each surface must have 1 boundary condition, to define a condition
# on all surfaces use 'all'.

# <name>.boundary_type (string): The type of boundary condition
#                                (dirichlet, neuman, robin)
# <name>.surface (comma separated list or 'all'): The surface the condition
#                                                 applies for.
# If using dirichlet, you should also define:
#     - g (the value on the boundary). This should be either a scalar value,
#       or a function defined as described at the bottom of this document.
#       e.g. bound.g.type: Constant ...
# If using neuman (not available yet!), you should also define:
#     - g (the derivative on the boundary). This should be a scalar or
#       function.
# If using robin (not available yet!), you should also define:
#     - alpha
#     - g
#fixed.boundary_type: dirichlet
#fixed.g: 100
#fixed.surface: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

[TIME]
# Time is used to define any time dependency in the problem.
# If this section is left blank, the problem is assumed to be steady state.
# Only 2 (any 2) of the settings in this section are needed, and the third can
# be calculated.

# steps (int): The number of steps to take.
# dt (float): The length of each time step.
# max_t (float): The maximum time to step until.
#steps: 10
#dt: 1e-12
#max_t: 1e-13

[INITIALVALUE]
# Initial values follow the same pattern as sources.
#
# Defaults to 0 across the mesh.
# default_initial_value: 0


# Functions:
# To define a function in TTiP, we use the following format
# <name>.type: <type>
# <name>.<param1>: <value1>
# ...
#
# For details on available functions and their parameters, please see the main
# documentation for TTiP.
