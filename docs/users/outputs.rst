Once a run completes, the results are saved to a set of files as defined in the
config file. For the examples, this is in a ``results`` directory.

There are two file types which are generated by TTiP, VTK data files, and a
paraview file to link them.

The VTK files will be numbered chronologically, one for each timestep, with the
0th file being the initial condition and the nth file being the result after n
timesteps. These should be compatible with a variety of visualisation software.

The Paraview file is used by Paraview to assemble the VTK files into a single object.
Loading this file into Paraview is the easiest way to visualise the data, help
on using paraview can be found in the :ref:`paraview_tips`.
