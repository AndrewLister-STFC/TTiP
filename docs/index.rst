================================

TTiP - Thermal Transfer in Plasma is a tool to solve heat transfer problems
specifically aimed at the plasma physics domain.

This tool uses `Firedrake <https://firedrakeproject.org/>`_ as the backend
solver. The install for this can take some time, alternatively a docker image
can be used as described on the Installing page.
