TTiP - Contributor Documentation
================================

Welcome to the contributor documentation for TTiP.

TTiP is built to be extendable in 2 main ways:

- *Problem definition*: The formula to be solved by the finite element code
  is highly extendable through the use of Mixin classes.

- *Functions*: The available functions for defining parameters can be extended
  through the use of function_builder classes.

These are both described more thoroughly in the linked pages above, as well as
throughout the source code.
