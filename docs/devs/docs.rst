=============

The documentation for TTiP is all stored in the ``docs`` directory and is
written to be used with sphinx.

A local copy of the documentation can be generated using::

   cd docs
   make html

An online copy of the documentation can be found on readthedocs, and is
automatically updated when commits are added to github.
