This is a simple case to get the project started with a proof of concept.
The main output of the project is a tool that will allow these problems to be run from a simpler interface (i.e. command line)
This problem is used to undestand what inputs need to be and how outputs can be returned

In the base case, we take the function to be:

C dT/dt = k laplacian(T) + S

where S = 0, C = const c, k proportional to T^(5/2) and T(x, y, z, t) to be simulated.
