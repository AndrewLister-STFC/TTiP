# TTiP - Thermal Transport in Plasma
This is a tool designed to solve thermal transfer problems in the field of plasma physics.

TTiP uses the [Firedrake project](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/) to solve finite element problems and provides a more accessable interface for solving a specific problem.
